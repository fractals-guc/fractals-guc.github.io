Define number to be be $boring$ if all digits of the number are the same. How many postivie integers 
less than $10000$ are both prime and boring?


## Sloution 

The one-digit boring primes are $2, 3, 5, 7$. The only 
two-digit boring prime is $11$ since $11$ divides 
all other two-digit boring numbers. 
No three digit boring numbers are prime, since $111$
divides all of them and $111 = 3 \times 37$.
No four-digit boring numbers are prime since they are 
all divisable by $11$. Therefore, there are 
$\boxed{5}$ postivie integers less than $10000$ which 
are both boring and prime.
