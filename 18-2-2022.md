How many positive integer $n$ are there, such that $\dfrac{(n-1)^2}{n+29}$ is an integer?


## Solution 

\[
    \frac{(n-1)^2}{n+29} = \frac{n^2 -2n +1}{n + 29} \overbrace{\Rightarrow}^{\text{long division}} n -31 + \frac{900}{n+29}
\]

Now the question is how many divisors for 900 that is greater than or equal 30

\[
    900 \underbrace{=}_{\text{prime factorization}} 2^23^25^2
\]
so the number of divisors is $(2+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 3^3 = 27$.

But those are all divisors, we are interested in the divisors $
\ge$ 30

This easy $900$ is a prefect square (his number of divisors is odd) 
and the divisors are distributed around $30$
so we have 13 divisor less than 30 and 30 and 13 greater than 30 
so the answer is clearly $\boxed{13 + 1 = 14}$.
