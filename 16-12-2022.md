You have five boxes in a row numbered 1 to 5, in which a cat is hiding. Every night he jumps to an adjacent box, and every morning you have one chance to open a box to find him. How do you win this game of hide and seek?

## Solution

Check boxes 2, 3, and 4 in order until you find him. Here’s why: He’s either in an odd or even-numbered box. If he’s in an even box (box 2 or 4) and you check box 2 and here’s there, great; if not you know he was in box 4, which means the next night he will move to box 3 or 5. The next morning, check box 3; if he’s not there that means he was in box 5 and so the next night he’ll be in box 4, and you’ve got him. If he was in an odd-numbered box to begin with (1, 3, or 5), though, you might not find him in that first round of checking boxes 2, 3 and 4. But if this is the case, you know that on the fourth night he’ll have to be in an even-numbered box (because he switches every night: odd, even, odd, even), so then you can start the process again as described above. This means if you check boxes 2, 3, and 4 in that order, you will find him within two rounds (one round of 2, 3, 4; followed by another round of  2, 3, 4).
