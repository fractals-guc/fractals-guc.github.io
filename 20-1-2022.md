Assume the polynomial $p(x) = x^8 − 12x^6 + 49x^4 − 78x^2 + 42$ has no complex roots. How many negative
real roots does it have?


## Sloution 

First note that $p$ is even function since 
\[
    p(-x) = (-x)^8 - 12(-x)^6 + 49(-x)^4  - 78(-x)^2 + 42 = 
     (x)^8 - 12(x)^6 + 49(x)^4  - 78(x)^2 + 42 = p(x)
\]
So $p(x)$ is symmetric around the $y-axix$ so the negative and postive roots are equal to 
$\dfrac{8}{2} = 4$


## Another Sloution using Descartes' Rule of Signs 

the number of postive roots is the number of change sign in the sequence of the coefficients.
\[
    sequence = 1, -12, 49, -78, 42
\]
the number of change signs is $(1, -12), (-12, 49), (49, -78), (-78, 42)$ 
which is $4$ thus we have $4$ postive real roots and $4$ negative ones
