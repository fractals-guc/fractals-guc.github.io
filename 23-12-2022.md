Calculate the area of HOE first and subtract it from the square area.

The white triangle HOE is similar to the triangle GOL. 

HE:GL=4:1. 

Therefore, 

Height of the HOE triangle with base HE: Height of the triangle GOL with base GL=4:1

Then, 

Height of the HOE triangle with base HE: Width of the square =4:5

The vertical extent of the white triangle (base) is 12 units. 

The horizontal extent (height) is 45×12 units. 

Thus the area covered by white triangle is 25×144 sq.units

The percentage of white area in the square =40%

So orange area =60%
